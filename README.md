# the-counting-bouncer
Exercise 10 of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera


## Description
Problem 1 - Getting started

Note: Some of the structure in this exercise matches what you did in Exercise 7. If you want to use that solution as your starting point for this exercise, go ahead; that's what I did!

Create a new Unity project and save the current scene. Add Edge Collider 2D components to the camera on all 4 sides of the screen. Turn off gravity (in the game). Add a bouncy, no friction Physics Material 2D to all the edge colliders and the Bouncer's collider.

Problem 2 - Adding a HUD

Add a Canvas to the Hierarchy window and rename the canvas HUD. Change the UI Scale Mode in the Canvas Scaler component of the canvas to Scale With Screen Size using a 1280 by 720 Reference Resolution. Add a HUD tag to the HUD canvas.

Add a Text component to the canvas and rename it BounceText. Change the characteristics of the Text component so that it's reasonably large, white text centered horizontally near the top of the screen.

Create a new HUD script and attach it to the HUD canvas. Open the script in your IDE.

Add a documentation comment at the top of the script. Declare a field to hold the Text  component, marking it with [SerializeField] so you can populate it in the Inspector. Remember, the Text class is in the UnityEngine.UI namespace. Go populate the field in the Inspector.

Add another field that holds the number of bounces that have happened in the game; initialize that field to 0.

In the Start method, set the text property of your Text field to the number of bounces that have happened in the game. You'll need to use the ToString method to get this to compile.

When you run the game, 0 should be displayed near the top center of the screen. Of course, that doesn't change at this point!

Add a public AddBounce method that increments the number of bounces that have happened in the game and updates the text property of your Text field appropriately.

Problem 3 - Counting the bounces

Implement a Unity class (script) called Bouncer that detects when it has collided with something. When it does, it should call the AddBounce method in the HUD script. Remember, we can find the HUD by its tag and we can use the GetComponent method to get a reference to the HUD script attached to the HUD. I added a field and did that work in the Start method so I could easily call the AddBounce method on a collision. You'll also need to get your object moving by adding a force in the Start method.

Add a sprite for your Bouncer game object to your project, add the Bouncer game object to the game, and attach a Rigidbody2D, some collider 2D, and your Bouncer script as components to the game object.

When you run your game, the bounce counter should increase by 1 every time the Bouncer hits an edge of the screen.
